FreeCodeCamp Show the Local Weather

This was another of the intermediate front end projects, and geolocating the user in order to give them local weather info.

User Stories:
- I can see the weather in my current location.
- I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
- I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

I plan on revisiting the weather icons and overall design aspect of this project
